                    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I've made my home base in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a curiosity that grew into a favorite past time. As I started sharing my work online, I was fascinated with how people freely ofered help and support to my learning. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to work with small businesses to strategize their online websites.</p>
