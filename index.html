<h3>My Journey to Tech</h3>

<p>I grew up in the 80's. I didn't have a computer until my early 20's.<br></p> <p>When I was in high school I quit typing class and decided I was going into the medical field. I figured I wouldn't have to learn typing. I was dead wrong, even though it took several years the medical field is now full of electronic charting.<br></p>
  <p>After spending 20 years in the medical field and raising my three children, I couldn't help but notice all the cool careers that are out in the world today. I am still young enough to want to learn and try a new career. I tried different online businesses with some success, but I wasn't into it, until I found tech.<br></p>
  <p>I love the ability to use my creativity, problem solving skills, learning new things and applying what I learn.<br></p>
  <p>This field satisfies just that for me. I enjoy the flexibility so I can still work in the medical field and do freelance tech or remote tech jobs. Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too?</p>
